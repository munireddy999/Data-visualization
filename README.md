# Food Coded Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a food-coded dataset. The primary tasks include processing the data, dealing with missing values, and visualizing the data before and after cleaning.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of pandas and data visualization libraries.
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Import Libraries and Dataset

- Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- Load the provided food-coded dataset into your environment.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Remove Null Values and Duplicates:** Clean the dataset by removing any null values and duplicates to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
- **Handle Missing Values:** Implement strategies to deal with missing values, such as imputation or removal.

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Visualize Before Cleaning:** Use various visualization techniques to understand the dataset before cleaning.
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Scatter plots
- **Visualize After Cleaning:** Use the same visualization techniques to compare and understand the changes after data cleaning.

## What You'll Learn

- Techniques for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Effective methods for handling missing values.
- How to use visualization to understand and interpret data.
